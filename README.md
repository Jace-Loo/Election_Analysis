# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview 
In this analysis, we audit data from the 1997 Colorado Congressional election between Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. In this analysis, we:
1. Calculated the total number of votes cast
2. Compiled a list of all candidates who received votes
3. Counted the total number of votes per candidate
4. Calculated the percentage of total votes each candidate received
5. Determined a winner based on popular vote
6. Counted the total number of votes per county
7. Determined the county with the largest voter turnout

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used to calculate election results for any election. For example, we could modify this code for the US Presidential Election coming up. The counties could be swapped out for states. The congressional candidates can be swapped out for presidential candidates. Code could be added to determine the winner of each state and how many electoral votes that results in. The number of electoral votes could then be used to determine the winner.
